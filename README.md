###Some Tech Considerations for Making SPA
1.**node.js** is an execution environment for JavaScript outside the browser plus some libraries for manipulating files and accessing the network

2.**Express** is a framework running on TOP of node.js, adding a formalized structure for building the backend for web applications. It help organize your web application into an MVC architecture on the server side.
One can then use a database like MongoDB with Mongoose (for modeling) to provide a backend for our Node.js application. Express.js basically helps you manage everything, from routes, to handling requests and views. [More Info](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12616153/what-is-express-js/17514674#17514674)

3.**Backbone** and **Angular** are frameworks that solely concerns themselves with the JavaScript running in the client.

>Backbone.Js and Angular.Js are stand-alone with no backend support - just HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and have "page switching" loading HTML templates through hash tag changes and load and save data through cookies or localStorage
